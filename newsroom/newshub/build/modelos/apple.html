              <strong><span class="pagebody-location">CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA</span> </strong>As Apple Music marks its
              10th anniversary this year, Apple unveils its most ambitious creative project to date: a brand-new
              state-of-the-art studio space in Los Angeles dedicated to artist-driven content, innovation in audio,
              and deeper fan connection.

            <div class="pagebody-copy">
              Opening this summer, the new studio represents a major milestone in Apple’s continued mission to support
              artists at every level by giving them the tools, platform, and creative freedom to tell their stories in
              entirely new ways. More than just a studio in the traditional sense, the new space is a creative campus
              that reflects a decade of Apple Music’s commitment to high-quality sound, authentic storytelling, and
              artist-first experiences.

              “Apple Music Radio has always been a home for storytelling and artistry, serving as a space for bold
              conversations and surprising moments,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s co-head. “With this new studio,
              we are furthering our commitment to creating a space for artists to create, connect, and share their
              vision.”

              places including New York, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, and Nashville, with additional studios coming soon.
              With this launch, the service continues to innovate, not just in how music is streamed, but also in how
              it’s made, experienced, and shared. From radio to live performance, to fan engagement and content
              creation, this new studio will serve as a creative home for the next decade of music.

            <div class="pagebody-copy">
              Since its inception, Apple Music Radio has been a defining feature of the service, a place where fans
              and artists meet in real time. From global premieres and intimate interviews, to in-depth specials and
              surprise performances, Apple Music Radio has distinguished itself through expertly curated, artist-led
              storytelling that makes listeners feel closer to the music they love. Apple Music Radio streams 24/7 and
              is available for free around the world.
            </div>

            <div class="pagebody-copy">
              “When we first launched Beats 1 it was a leap of faith, the first live global radio station for a
              digital world,” said Zane Lowe. “We knew we wanted to build something special where artists could come
              and tell their stories and fans could feel connected. Ten years on, Apple Music Radio is everything we
              hoped it would be. It’s a place where we can eventize music, a place where music comes first, always.
              I’m just as excited for what’s to come as I was on day one.”
            </div>

            <div class="pagebody-copy">
              To celebrate the 10-year milestone, Apple Music Radio will feature a week of specials and live
              programming, kicking off with
              <strong>“Don’t Be Boring: The Birth of Apple Music Radio with Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden”</strong> on
              June 30, from 6 to 8 a.m. PST. From the early days of launching radio on streaming, to the epic
              artist-led shows that defined a new era, Zane, Ebro, and special guests will reminisce about the last 10
              years of Apple Music Radio. Then, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. PST, listeners can tune in to the
              <strong>“10 Years of Apple Music” </strong>special. This eight-hour broadcast event on Apple Music 1
              will tell the stories of the greatest artist moments, exclusive releases, live events, and cultural
              milestones that only Apple could deliver. The day will culminate with
              <strong>“Live: 10 Years Of Apple Music” </strong>from 4 to 7 p.m. PST. The live broadcast, hosted by
              Zane and Ebro, celebrates a decade of Apple Music with a lineup of artists who have shaped the
              trajectory of the service. Listeners can tune in at

            <div class="pagebody-copy">
              Additionally, Apple Music Radio will unveil the service’s top 500 most-streamed songs from the last 10
              years in a special countdown beginning on Tuesday, July 1. Tune in to count down 100 songs a day,
              culminating with Apple Music’s top 100 most-streamed songs of all time on July 5, when the full

                        <strong><span class="pagebody-location">CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA</span> </strong>As Apple Music
                        marks its 10th anniversary this year, Apple unveils its most ambitious creative project to
                        date: a brand-new state-of-the-art studio space in Los Angeles dedicated to artist-driven
                        content, innovation in audio, and deeper fan connection.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Opening this summer, the new studio represents a major milestone in Apple’s continued mission
                        to support artists at every level by giving them the tools, platform, and creative freedom to
                        tell their stories in entirely new ways. More than just a studio in the traditional sense, the
                        new space is a creative campus that reflects a decade of Apple Music’s commitment to
                        high-quality sound, authentic storytelling, and artist-first experiences.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “Apple Music Radio has always been a home for storytelling and artistry, serving as a space
                        for bold conversations and surprising moments,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s co-head.
                        “With this new studio, we are furthering our commitment to creating a space for artists to
                        create, connect, and share their vision.”

                        Apple Music’s new Los Angeles studio will anchor a global network of creative hubs already
                        active in places including New York, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, and Nashville, with additional
                        studios coming soon. With this launch, the service continues to innovate, not just in how
                        music is streamed, but also in how it’s made, experienced, and shared. From radio to live
                        performance, to fan engagement and content creation, this new studio will serve as a creative
                        home for the next decade of music.

                      <p><strong>The Power of Apple Music Radio</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        Since its inception, Apple Music Radio has been a defining feature of the service, a place
                        where fans and artists meet in real time. From global premieres and intimate interviews, to
                        in-depth specials and surprise performances, Apple Music Radio has distinguished itself
                        through expertly curated, artist-led storytelling that makes listeners feel closer to the
                        music they love. Apple Music Radio streams 24/7 and is available for free around the world.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “When we first launched Beats 1 it was a leap of faith, the first live global radio station
                        for a digital world,” said Zane Lowe. “We knew we wanted to build something special where
                        artists could come and tell their stories and fans could feel connected. Ten years on, Apple
                        Music Radio is everything we hoped it would be. It’s a place where we can eventize music, a
                        place where music comes first, always. I’m just as excited for what’s to come as I was on day
                        one.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To celebrate the 10-year milestone, Apple Music Radio will feature a week of specials and live
                        programming, kicking off with
                        <strong>“Don’t Be Boring: The Birth of Apple Music Radio with Zane Lowe and Ebro
                          Darden”</strong>
                        on June 30, from 6 to 8 a.m. PST. From the early days of launching radio on streaming, to the
                        epic artist-led shows that defined a new era, Zane, Ebro, and special guests will reminisce
